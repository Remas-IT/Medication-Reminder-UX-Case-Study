# Medication Reminder Mobile Application – UX Research & Evaluation Case Study

## 1. Project Overview
This academic group project focused on designing and evaluating a mobile medication reminder application tailored for elderly users. The project applied Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) principles and usability heuristics to address medication adherence challenges among older adults.

Developed as part of IT215 – HCI Course.

---

## 2. Problem Context
Elderly individuals often struggle with medication adherence due to:
- Memory challenges
- Multiple daily medications
- Low digital familiarity
- Visual limitations

The objective was to design an accessible, simple, and reliable reminder system that supports this demographic.

---

## 3. Design & Prototype Summary
The system included:
- Login and Sign-Up screens
- Home screen displaying daily medications
- Add Medication form
- Profile screen
- Notifications screen
- Confirmation screen

An interactive prototype was created using Balsamiq.

## 4. Evaluation Phase (My Primary Contribution)

### 4.1 Usability Testing Method

The interactive prototype was evaluated with three elderly participants (ages 58–71).

Method used:
- Direct observation
- Task-based testing
- Performance recording
- Error tracking
  
The evaluation process was grounded in established usability heuristics, particularly Nielsen’s principles of visibility, consistency, and error prevention.

Tasks evaluated:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to Personal Info
3. Navigate to Notifications
4. Add new medication
5. Save medication and return home

Observation focused on:
- Navigation clarity
- Button visibility
- Icon recognition
- Text readability
- User hesitation

---

### 4.2 Key Usability Findings

The evaluation revealed several usability barriers:

- Low contrast text reduced readability for **2 out of 3 participants**.  
- Small font sizes affected elderly users with visual limitations (all 3 participants).  
- Abstract icons caused navigation confusion for **2 participants**.  
- Ambiguous confirmation buttons created hesitation for **2 out of 3 users**.  
- Low-contrast Cancel button particularly affected the participant with visual impairment.

Users with limited smartphone experience required assistance in multiple tasks.

However:
- Core task flow remained functional
- All users eventually completed main tasks
- Add Medication button was easily discoverable

---

## 5. Research-Based Analysis

The findings align with established gerontechnology literature:

- Reduced contrast negatively impacts elderly readability
- Concrete and familiar icons improve recognition
- Clear labeling reduces cognitive load
- Large typography enhances usability

References used are included in the full report.

## 6. Conclusion & Future Improvements (My Contribution)

Based on evaluation results, the following improvements were proposed:

1. Increase font size and color contrast for all essential interactive elements.
2. Replace abstract navigation icons with universally recognized symbols.
3. Redesign confirmation screen with explicit labels (e.g., "Return to Home").
4. Introduce voice-assisted navigation for accessibility.
5. Conduct broader usability testing with larger elderly sample.
6. Develop high-fidelity and functional prototype for real-world validation.

These improvements aim to enhance accessibility, reduce cognitive strain, and increase task success rates.
